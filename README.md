# bangle.Js Smartwatch activity tracking

The following project is a demonstration of rapid prototyping of embedded devices and wearables using javaScript as a programming language. The developement is done on Bangle.js smartwatch platform which is a open source hackable smartwatch. 

## Project Environment

### Software Environment

**JavaScript Development:** Bangle.js leverages JavaScript as its primary programming language, allowing developers to write applications directly on the device using familiar tools and libraries.

**Web IDE:** The Bangle.js ecosystem provides a convenient web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing, testing, and deploying applications to the smartwatch. This IDE offers a seamless development experience without the need for complex setup or installations.

### Hardware Environment
The Bangle.js smartwatch boasts a range of sensors and features, including an accelerometer, heart rate monitor, GPS, Bluetooth connectivity, and a vibrant color display. These hardware capabilities provide a rich foundation for building diverse applications and experiences.

## Project Details

**Sensor Integration**: The project harnesses the power of multiple sensors embedded within the Bangle.JS smartwatch, including accelerometers, gyroscopes, barometer and heart rate sensor.

**Activity Detection**: Through dynamic sensor data analysis, the project accurately detects whether the user is ascending or descending stairs or utilizing a lift/elevator.

**Machine Learning Prediction**: To enhance the accuracy of activity detection, machine learning techniques are employed. The smartwatch learns from historical sensor data to predict user activity in real-time, providing more reliable insights.

**Real-time Feedback**: Users receive instant feedback on their activity patterns directly on the smartwatch display, promoting awareness and encouraging healthier lifestyle choices.

Following are the steps followed:

- Data Collection 
- Data Preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- model training and testing
- model deployment on hardware
